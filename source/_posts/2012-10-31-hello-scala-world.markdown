I've just published an <a href="https://github.com/mcaserta/hello-scala-world" title="Hello Scala World!">Hello Scala World! project on GitHub</a> that you can use to quickly setup a Scala hacking environment. This is particularly useful if you run Intellij Idea with the Scala plugin since simply opening the pom as a project will get you all the comforts you would expect in a modern ide.

You also get support for running <a href="http://etorreborre.github.com/specs2/">specs2 specifications</a>.
