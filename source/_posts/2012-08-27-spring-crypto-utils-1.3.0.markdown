I’ve released a new version of Spring Crypto Utils. The project now has a gorgeous, shiny, sleek, new website on the <a href="http://springcryptoutils.com" title="Spring Crypto Utils">springcryptoutils.com</a> domain. The website is made possible thanks to the kind folks at <a href="https://github.com/" title="GitHub">GitHub</a> and their <a href="http://pages.github.com/" title="GitHub Pages">GitHub pages</a> hosting facility.

Please read the notes in the <a href="http://springcryptoutils.com/changelog.html" title="Spring Crypto Utils: ChangeLog">changelog</a> if you’re upgrading.

I must say moving to GitHub was a smart move since contributing to the project is very much easier now thanks to git pull requests. I would like to thank Chad Johnston and Martin Bosak for their contributions: respectively, <a href="https://github.com/mcaserta/spring-crypto-utils/commit/b0c7e8dab8c3f9ead869055aa460feb0dc5af4f6">the certificate element</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/mcaserta/spring-crypto-utils/commit/15f305e522bd3c85eec7cc46a50e18385f324b9e">provider attribute</a>.

I hope users will find the documentation easier to read. Here is an example regarding <a href="http://springcryptoutils.com/signature-m.html">digital signatures with runtime selection of multiple keys</a>.
